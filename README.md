    The Dzhanibekov Effect, aka the Intermediate Axis Theorem/Tennis Racket theorem, is one of the most interesting phenomena in classical mechanics. 
    It is defined by a rigid body with three distinct moments of inertia about its principal axes. The effect occurs when the body is rotated about its intermediate axis and experiences a slight perturbation in its spin about this axis. 
    The object then seems to experience a half rotation about a separate axis after a certain amount of rotations.

    Before finding the equations of motion for this, we must first define the system itself. For this project, I decided to go with a 4 particle system in which q<sub>1</sub> and q<sub>2</sub> are connected to each other and have a significantly higher mass than q<sub>3</sub> and q<sub>4</sub>. 
    The distance between q<sub>1</sub> and q<sub>2</sub> are also significantly further apart from each other than the distance between q<sub>3</sub> and q<sub>4</sub>. Doing so we get a minimum moment of inertia about n<sub>x</sub>, a maximum moment of inertia about n<sub>z</sub>, and an intermediate moment of inertia about n<sub>y</sub>. 
    This setup can be seen in the following figure below:
